This project is a adaption of the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X80nJ5T7YpE

The original tutorial was created using an old bootstrap version, then I recreated the same app using the version 2.5.8

To change to using a DB change the source:
```
io.javabrains.springsecurityjwt.services.MyUserDetailsService
```
Check the Postman-Files directory to use the request using in this example.
